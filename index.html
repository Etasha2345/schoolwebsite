                                <p>A Cultural Exchange Program was organized by Le Frehindi in Nantes & Paris, France between 20 May 2019- 28 May 2019. Four of our curious & enthusiastic students - Kritika Vatsa (VIII), Garima Vatsa (XI), Gauri Seth & Ritik
                                    Raj (X) along with faculty member Ms. Divya Sood grabbed the opportunity to attend Collège Salvador Allende in Nantes, Paris. Each student was hosted by the French students and their families. While the Indian students
                                    became the ambassadors of their country to share all the richness of their customs & traditions, the French went out of their way to make this stay a memorable one by organizing endless activities such as, cooking,
                                    music lessons, dance, role play, hand ball, yoga apart from the regular classroom teaching. They ensured that their Indian friends discovered their entire region by taking them to beautiful castles, theme parks, the
                                    river side and to Buren's rings on Loire River. Attending class was a unique experience too as was the city tour. Biding Adieu was the most difficult part for all of us. Students exchanged small gifts to express their
                                    gratitude and shared their contact details to strengthen their connections. </p>

                                <p>Manava Bharati India International School has a long association with The Centre for Science and Environment’s (CSE) - Green Schools Programme. This programme helps the students to move beyond theories and textbooks and
                                    concentrates solely on ‘doing’. It is an environmental education programme directed to subtly sensitizing students to the environment through hands-on and thought provoking activities. An award ceremony was held in
                                    India Habitat Centre, Lodhi Road on Tuesday, 6 February 2020 where Ms. Sunita Narayan gave away Centre for Science and Environment’s Green Schools Awards. Seventeen schools from Delhi were awarded for their contribution
                                    to environment on the basis of parameters such as awareness activities involving students and community, basic infrastructure such as composting pit, rainwater harvesting structure and solid waste collection points
                                    for waste segregation and their participation in GSP Audit. </p>
